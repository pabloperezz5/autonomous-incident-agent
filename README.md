# Autonomous Incident Analysis Agent

An AI-powered infrastructure incident analysis system that automatically investigates alerts from OpsGenie using Grafana metrics, dashboards, logs and provides intelligent root cause analysis and remediation recommendations.

## 🎯 Purpose

When infrastructure alerts trigger in your monitoring system, this autonomous agent:

1. **Receives alerts** from OpsGenie via webhooks
2. **Autonomously investigates** using Grafana metrics, logs, and dashboards
3. **Analyzes root causes** using Claude AI with full context awareness
4. **Provides actionable recommendations** for incident resolution
5. **Updates OpsGenie tickets** with comprehensive analysis results

The agent gives Claude complete autonomy to decide which monitoring data to examine, what patterns to look for, and how to correlate information across different systems - resulting in thorough, intelligent incident analysis without human intervention.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![alt text](<autonomous incident agent-1.png>)

- **Main Application**: Python FastAPI service that orchestrates the analysis workflow
- **Grafana MCP Server**: Provides access to metrics, logs, and dashboards via Model Context Protocol
- **OpsGenie MCP Server**: Handles ticket updates and alert management
- **Claude AI**: Conducts autonomous investigation using available tools and data sources

## 🔄 Workflow

```
OpsGenie Alert → Webhook → Main Application → Claude Investigation → Analysis → Updated Ticket
```

1. Infrastructure issue triggers alert in Grafana
2. Grafana sends alert to OpsGenie
3. OpsGenie webhook notifies the autonomous agent
4. Agent provides Claude with alert context and available tools
5. Claude autonomously investigates using Grafana data
6. Claude generates comprehensive analysis report
7. Agent updates OpsGenie ticket with findings and recommendations

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Faster**: Immediate analysis reduces time to resolution, saving a lot of time for the team in charge of resolving the incident, as it gives them a clear picture of what is happening, possible root causes and recommendations.
- **24/7 Coverage**: Autonomous operation without human availability constraints
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Analysis results improve team understanding of systems
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple concurrent incidents without bottlenecks
